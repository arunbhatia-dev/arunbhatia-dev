### Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="28">

I'm Arun, a software engineer from Helsinki, Finland.

I currently work as a Software Developer at [@Digia](https://digia.com), working on AI and data-driven projects.

I'm fascinated by high-impact products and technologies that make a difference. My work spans machine learning, computer vision, and full-stack development using Python, TypeScript, React, and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure).

Outside of work, I enjoy sports, science, and exploring new technologies. I am passionate about continuous learning and always looking for opportunities to grow both personally and professionally.
