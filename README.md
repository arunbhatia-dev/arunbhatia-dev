### Hi there!

I'm Arun, a software engineer from Helsinki, Finland.

I currently work as a Software Developer at **Digia**, working on AI and data-driven projects. Previously, I was a Data Scientist at **Kelluu** and ML Engineer Trainee at **Savox Communications**.

I'm fascinated by high-impact products and technologies that make a difference. My work spans machine learning, computer vision, and full-stack development using Python, TypeScript, React, and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure).
